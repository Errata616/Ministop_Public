<h1>I made this project in my free time as a way to learn Python.</h1>

Originally, I started with this idea when I was buying stuff in convenient store and wondering how did they make a program that can show options, handle customer's choices, as well as calculate total money and print out a bill

This program basically simulates a convenient store managing program. With both input and output displayed on the terminal.
